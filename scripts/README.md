## Notes
- Most scripts source the merged and cleaned dataframes using "get_data.R" which is a great way to save time, be consistent, and make the analysis slightly more portable. Highly recommend.
- R analyses and visualizations were run locally on a MacBook Pro (Apple M3 Max chip).
- CONSORT diagram was made manually in PowerPoint.
